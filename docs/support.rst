How to Submit a GitHub Issue
============================

1. Go to the project GitHub `here <https://github.com/kzvezdarov/ircdd>`_
2. Click on "Issues"
3. Click on "New Issue"
4. Give the issue a proper title such as "Component x fails on error y after condition z"
5. Include the following in the body:

- A detailed description of the bug itself
- Steps on how to replicate the issue
- Any associated log files

The issue will be dealt with in an appropriate and timely fashion. If the issue is unreplicateable, the issue will be commented upon, marked as a random occurence bug, and closed. If the issue is replicated, it will be assigned, worked upon and closed if a solution is found. We are only able to resolve bugs within the implemented system itself, not with any if the libraries the system uses.
